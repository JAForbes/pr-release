# pr-release

> ðŸš¨ This repo does nothing right now, I'm just experimenting.  Do not use this.

https://pr-release.org/

## Quick Start

- Generate an admin personal access token and add it to your repo env as `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- If publishing to NPM, generate an NPM auth token and add it to your repo env as `NPM_TOKEN`
- Create a branch called `next` and set it as the default branch for the repo
- Create a branch called `main`
- Add branch protection rules to `next` and `main`
- Run: `npx pr-release actions-yml --source next --target main` to generate all the CI config for your repo, commit the output to `next` and merge into `main`
- Your repo now has managed releases, rollbacks, automatic feature branch PRs, auto updating changelog and more!

## What is it?

`pr-release` lets you manage your releases for applications and libraries with a simple branching workflow

```
feature-branch -> staging-branch -> production-branch
```

Typically the staging branch is called `next`, and the production-branch is called `main`.

`pr-release` will generate a release PR template any time a feature branch is merged into `next`.

You can edit that template to customize the generated changelog and release.  

Upon merging, `pr-release` will create a github release, changelog and prepare for an npm package publication.

## How do I customize it?

Mostly by using native github features like labels, the PR description and title and not much else.

The following labels will change how `pr-release` generates a release:

- `major`   Signals a feature branch (causes breaking changes)
- `minor`   Signals a feature branch (causes minor changes)
- `patch`   Signals a feature branch (is a safe patch upgrade)

The PR description will also have generated markdown sections.  `pr-release` will use these sections to generate the changelog and other metadata.

## FAQ

### How do I configure my Github actions to use `pr-release`?

Run `npx pr-release actions-yml`.  It will generate all the yml files you need to use all the features of `pr-release`.

From there you can edit the generated files to tailor specific behavior as required.

### How do I update package.json to include the version

When running `npx pr-release merge` pass along `--commit`.  If you have a `package.json` `pr-release` will automatically update the version in that file to match the release version.

Note `--commit` will also commit all other changes in the working directory via the Github API.  This allows you to run custom build steps to e.g. build documentation and have them included on the target branch but not the source branch.

And this works with protected branches enabled.

### How do I publish to npm

After running `npx pr-release merge --commit` run `npm publish`.  `npm` will use the `version` in package.json that `pr-release` updated.

Note, you must have an `NPM_TOKEN` available in CI.  You can generate an NPM Token by following [these instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-token).  You'll need to then follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to add the secret to your Github Actions workflows.

### What environment variables do I need to make this work?

If you are running `pr-release` within Github Actions, you do not need to configure environment variables except `GITHUB_TOKEN` (and optionally `NPM_TOKEN`) because we use variables that Github provides out of the box.

But, if you are running `pr-release` locally or in some other context, you will need to provide the following:


```.env
GITHUB_TOKEN="..."
GITHUB_REPOSITORY="..."
GITHUB_SHA="..."
GITHUB_REF="..."
```

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is necessary for pr-release to do any of the work it does.  By design `pr-release` never uses `git` to make changes to the repo.  This is so `pr-release` can operate outside of the normal branch protection rules provided by github, and to give you the best possible auditing experience.  We do not use the default token provided by github actions because it will be restricted to branch protection rules.  You will need to generate a token of an admin account on your repository so that pr-release can generate release artifacts on the main protected branch.

If `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is not provided, pr-release will exit.  Even if you are running locally in a `.git` context, we will never sniff the output of `git remote -v`.  By making repository selection explicit, it is possible for forks to to still target the correct repository, or to have management repositories that manage releases across an entire company.

If `GITHUB_SHA` is not specified, `pr-release` will make an API call to identify the relevant sha for the given command.  If the relevant sha is not inferrable, `pr-release` will exit with a non zero code. 

`GITHUB_REF` is used to identify if there is already a pull request for the current branch.  This is especially useful for automatically generating feature branches on push.

### How do I do concurrent release channels?

Have a target branch for each channel e.g. `v1` and a release candidate branch like `v1-next`:

```
# Generate/update a release PR for v1 channel
npx pr-release pr --source v1-next --target v1

# Generate/update a release PR for v2 channel
npx pr-release pr --source v2-next --target v2
```

version: 0.16.0

pr-release subcommand --options

subcommands:

  global flags

    --source <branch>

                        (default=next) Specify the branch that is considered the staging branch.

    --target <branch>

                        (default=main) Specify the branch that is considered the production branch.

  pr

                        Updates or creates the release PR.  Should run on every relevant merge event.

    --compact

                        Less ceremonial changelog output.

    --no-contributors

                        Do not include contributor information in PR description or changelog

    --no-thanks

                        Do not thank contributors in changelog or release PR

  merge

                        Commits updated changelog and creates new npm/github/etc release.
                        Should run on every relevant merge event.

    --force

                        Will repair the target branch if a fast forward update is not possible.  
                        Otherwise will simply error that the branches have diverged or exit with
                        code zero if everything is fine.

    --clean

                        By default --force will archive the old target branch under an alias.
                        Use --clean to remove the archived old target branch once the process has
                        completed successfully.

    --changelog

                        Generate/update the markdown changelog.

  actions-yml

                        Scaffold Github actions yml files

  feature-pr

                        Generate a feature-pr for the current branch that targets
                        the source branch if the push event is not for the target
                        or source branch.

  rollback

                        Updates the --source and --target branch to a previous
                        release point but retains version information and any
                        other excluded files (e.g. package.json/lock).

                        Unlike git revert we do not apply changes that undoes
                        the current change, we rewind time to that point 
                        in time and then re-apply specific changes like git tags
                        and manifest files.

                        The previous version of history is kept in a new branch
                        which is called rollback-<old-version-slug>-<new-version-slug>
                        where the slug is replacing special characters with underscores.

                        This branch will then automatically have a PR created targeting
                        the --source branch that if merged would generate a release PR that would 
                        reinstate the state prior to rolling back.

                        This is a perfect place to identify fixes for the issue that triggered
                        a rollback in the first place.

    --version=<tag>

                        The version, git ref or SHA to rollback too.  The version
                        must exist in the --source history.  If not provided 
                        the version will be inferred to be the last release.
                        We identify releases by searching through the github releases
                        API response.

    --ignore <glob>

                        Specify files that should not be rolled back.  Any files matching these globs
                        will be re-applied to the rollback commit.  This is useful for 
                        maintaining version updates in manifest files such as package.json.

  infer-version

                        Outputs the version pr-release estimates the next release should be.
                        This is the same function used to generate the versions in the title
                        header and body but as a standalone command.

  Advanced Commands
  -----------------

  repair-target

                        Generate a new target branch from the source sha.  Helpful
                        if your target branch has a different history to the source
                        branch (e.g. an accidental squash into target).

    --force

                        Will only repair the target branch with a --force flag.  Otherwise
                        will simply error that the branches have diverged or exit with
                        code zero if everything is fine.

    --clean

                        By default will archive the old target branch.  Use --clean
                        to remove the old target branch.
